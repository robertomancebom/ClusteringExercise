# OkCupid Clustering

[![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/robertomancebom/OkCupidClustering)

This notebook is an exercise that tries to visualize different OkCupid profiles and group them into clusters.
In order to achieve that, we used different tools and algorithms as tf-idf Vectorizer, UMAP, K-Means or HDBSCAN among others.

Here there are some of the results of the analysis but you can find more on the notebook.
